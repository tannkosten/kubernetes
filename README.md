My silly kubernetes helm templates

I used the [ansible playbook](https://github.com/techno-tim/k3s-ansible) made by Techno Tim, it's amazing.

I also used these:
* [Techno Tim - Cert Manager and Traefik](https://docs.technotim.live/posts/kube-traefik-cert-manager-le/)
* [Techno Tim - Longhorn](https://docs.technotim.live/posts/longhorn-install/)
* [Christian Lempa - ArgoCD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yb3_4PZX0B0)

You add the appofapps to ArgoCD, and that should (if you configure it properly), deploy the other apps automatically.
